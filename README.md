A not-very-good coder's experiments with Clojure and Project Euler
==================================================================

So this is my attempt to learn some [Clojure](http://clojure.org) via
the programming problems at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

I'd be a filthy liar if I didn't acknowledge the immense help I got
from [the clojure-euler
wiki](http://clojure-euler.wikispaces.com/). Some of these solutions
will look like they're basically cribbed from there - and, well, they
sometimes are. My goal here was not to flex my coder muscles and prove
my badassness by solving everything without any assistance - rather,
I've been trying to learn Clojure *and* get my head around some
interesting algorithmic/mathematic problems. So yeah, if I was stuck,
I looked at solutions - but then I did my best to build out how
someone else had solved the problem myself, so that I'd actually learn something.

I meant to keep my work in here as much as possible -
including my aborted attempts and my kinda sad attempts to remember
how to solve quadratic equations, but not everything actually stuck
around. Also, the comments - yeah, not the most useful in the world,
but hopefully they can entertain a little.
